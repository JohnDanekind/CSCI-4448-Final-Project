## Description: ## 
This is my ongoing implementation and progress on my MancalaAI project. 
MancalaAI is an object-oriented GUI implementation of the popular board game Mancala. 
The final implementation will have a human player play the computer. The human player
will be able to choose a difficulty level which will determine the strategy the computer
will use to select the next move. In the current version, the GUI is working and stones are distributed
according to some of the rules of the game. In the final version, the human player
will be able to play by clicking on the board and stones will be distributed. In addition, there will be 
additional strategy classes that make use of the Minimax algorithm as well as alpha-beta-pruning.
